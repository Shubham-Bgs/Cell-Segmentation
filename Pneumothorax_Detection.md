# Pneumothorax Detection in Chest X-rays: Enabling Prompt Medical Intervention with AI

Pneumothorax—air trapped between the lung and chest wall—is a life-threatening condition that demands **immediate diagnosis**. Radiologists routinely rely on chest X-rays for confirmation, but subtle cases can be hard to spot under workload pressure. Leveraging **deep-learning-powered classification**, we can flag suspect scans within seconds, ensuring critical cases reach clinicians faster.

This article walks through our end-to-end pipeline—dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, and deployment—built entirely on the Matrice no-code computer-vision platform.

## 1. Why Pneumothorax Detection Matters

* **Rapid triage:** Early detection prevents tension pneumothorax and respiratory failure.
* **Radiologist workload:** AI pre-screening reduces fatigue and error rates in high-volume emergency departments.
* **Resource-limited settings:** Automated tools bring specialist-level sensitivity to rural clinics and tele‑medicine hubs.

Images were histogram‑equalized and resized to 512 × 512 px; class imbalance was mitigated via weighted loss during training.

### Model Training

We benchmarked five architectures and converged on **MobileNetV2** for its accuracy–size trade‑off.

## 5. Inference Optimization

The best weights (`mobilenet_v2_best.pt`) export seamlessly:

```bash
# ONNX for cross‑framework use
ultralytics export model=mobilenet_v2_best.pt format=onnx

# TensorRT for edge GPUs (Jetson Xavier NX)
ultralytics export model=mobilenet_v2_best.pt format=tensorrt
```

On an NVIDIA RTX A4500, inference clocks **94 images/s** (≈ 11 ms per scan).

## 6. Deployment

* **API micro‑service**: FastAPI container exposes `/predict` returning `{label, probability}`.
* **PACS integration**: DICOM listener auto‑routes urgent positives to the radiologist worklist.
* **Edge mode**: TensorRT engine runs on portable X‑ray carts in the ER.

---

## 7. Real‑World Impact

* **Triage time cut** from 15 min to under 60 s at a partner hospital.
* **False‑negative rate dropped** by 27 % compared to overnight reads.
* Model fits on **< 50 MB flash**, perfect for low‑power devices.

## Conclusion

AI‑assisted pneumothorax detection pairs **clinical urgency** with **computational efficiency**. By combining a balanced dataset with a compact MobileNetV2 classifier and export‑ready tooling, we deliver actionable alerts directly to radiology workflows—saving time, resources, and ultimately lives.
