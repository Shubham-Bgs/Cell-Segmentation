-   **Improved Throughput:** Optimizes the flow of operations by ensuring each step is completed correctly, reducing bottlenecks and rework.
-   **Worker Safety:** Monitors for unsafe conditions, incorrect human-machine interactions, or the absence of safety gear, contributing to a safer working environment.
-   **Waste Reduction:** Early detection of defects or process errors reduces material waste and the cost associated with scrapping or reworking faulty products.
-   **Process Optimization:** Gathers data on assembly processes, which can be analyzed to identify areas for improvement, enhance cycle times, and streamline workflows.

The ability to instantly detect and classify various states, components, and potential anomalies on a fast-moving assembly line is crucial for maintaining high productivity and quality standards.
